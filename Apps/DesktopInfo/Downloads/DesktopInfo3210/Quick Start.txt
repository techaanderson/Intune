Desktop Info by Glenn Delahoy
=============================
https://www.glenn.delahoy.com

This is the TL;DR document to get you started.

Desktop Info will work out of the box with no configuration. It starts by creating a very basic 
default configuration file which you can modify to suit your needs. It's a text file so just open it in Notepad 
or your favourite text editor. All the information you need to customise the configuration is in the manual. 
However, Desktop Info kindly provides a number of sample configuration files in the sample-config folder. Just 
copy one of these to the main folder with the .exe files and rename it to desktopinfo.ini. Desktop Info will now 
run with the new configuration. 

If Desktop Info has multiple pages of information, you'll see some navigation buttons at the bottom.

You can drag an .ini configuration file on to the .exe file to execute Desktop Info with that configuration file. 
You can create a Windows shortcut with an .ini file parameter.

The manual is very big and comprehensive, I don't blame you if you don't want to wade through it. I suggest you 
see how far you get without it and when you get stuck, ctrl-f and search for what you want, browse the contents,
see if I've done it in the "sample-config\desktopinfo-advanced.ini" file and if all else fails search the forums.


Q & A
=====
Q. Where's the Release Notes or list of changes?
A. It's at the end of the manual PDF. It's in a post on the forums. It's in a post on Ko-fi.

Q. How do I get rid of the title?
A. Open the ini file in a text editor, look for the first COMMENT line and delete it or modify it to suit your 
needs.

Q. What other information can it show?
A. Copy the sample-config\desktopinfo-advanced.ini file to the main folder and rename it to desktopinfo.ini. When 
you run Desktop Info you'll now see dozens of pages of information. Now browse the manual PDF. Everything is
documented there.

Q. Can I request new features?
A. You can try. Leave a request on the forums. Maybe someone knows how to do it already.
